What is important as a software developer to earn money with good work-life balance? - Based on Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019
Software developers has the image that doing lots of overtime work.
However, there is some of them are having good income and also keeping there work-life balance good. Naturally, I asked myself: Can I be one of them? Is it too late for me? What should I do for that? With these question, I did a brief research with the 2019 Stack Overflow's annual Developer Survey.The survey includes nearly 90,000 developers answer.
For simplicity,I look at professional developers in the top 10 apearance of countries:'United States', 'India', 'United Kingdom', 'Germany', 'Canada', 'France', 'Brazil', 'Poland', 'Australia', 'Netherlands', 'Russian Federation'.
In addition,call the group of people who has both of good income and good work-life balance as "star-group".
To focus on the "star-group", I extract these who think about their career 'Slightly satisfied' and 'Very satisfied' group. Moreover,to avoid the group of people who earning money by getting lots of overtime pay, I decided to look at "hourly income" instead of "annual income".
"hourly income" = "annual income" / "work hours".
I raised these 4 questions as below.
What programming language is popular in the "star-group"?
What kind of database is popular in the "star-group"?
How old and how many years coding as professional developer are they in the "star-group"?
What is the key factors of having over than medium income and keeping work-life balance?
